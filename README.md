# v3-gauntlet

An unattended ticket pipeline for Claude Code, packaged as a plugin. Forked from
[beefysalad/patrick-workflows](https://github.com/beefysalad/patrick-workflows) and being fitted to one
work project. The plan is to run it unattended on a Linux host.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add patrick-gogo/v3-gauntlet
/plugin install v3-gauntlet@v3-gauntlet
```

Local checkout: `/plugin marketplace add /path/to/v3-gauntlet`

## Update

```
/plugin marketplace update v3-gauntlet
/plugin update v3-gauntlet@v3-gauntlet
```

Restart Claude Code afterwards. Installs are cached by `version`, so a change
only reaches other machines after `version` is bumped in
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Skills |
| `commands/<name>.md` | Slash commands |
| `agents/<name>.md` | Subagents |
| `hooks/` | PreToolUse guard (`guard.sh`, registered in `hooks.json`) |
| `templates/` | CLAUDE.md and settings.json to copy manually (plugins can't ship these) |

## /v3-ticket

```
/v3-ticket ABC-123        start or continue a ticket (ID, URL, or pasted text)
/v3-ticket                list tickets in this repo
```

- **PLAN (with you):** reads the ticket, settles acceptance criteria, creates the branch (or a worktree, if you ask for one), brainstorms the design, writes the plan, and agrees an autonomy brief: gates, scope, review depth, budget, an optional exit pair, and the permission rules to add.
- **BUILD (on its own):** one fresh implementer and reviewer per task, test first, gates re-run by the orchestrator, then the `/v3-review` loop. Asks nothing.
- **SHIP (with you):** one report with numbered questions. Ask for changes and it runs a second round; say yes and it scans for secrets, then opens a draft PR.

Run `/v3-ticket <id>` again at any time to resume where it stopped. If another plugin also defines `/v3-ticket` or `/v3-review`, use the namespaced form: `/v3-gauntlet:v3-ticket`, `/v3-gauntlet:v3-review`. Working files live in `~/.v3-gauntlet/tickets/<repo>/<id>/`. After the PR is merged, run `/v3-ticket <id>` once more: it marks the ticket done (a GitHub issue is closed by the URL recorded at intake, never by bare number) and cleans up. After a squash or rebase merge it deletes the local branch with `-D` only when the branch tip is exactly the commit GitHub merged; otherwise it keeps the branch and says why.

Optional: list company names and internal hostnames, one per line, in your work project's `.claude/v3-gauntlet-deny.txt`. SHIP refuses to open a PR whose body or diff contains them.

Permission rules: absolute paths outside your home directory need a leading `//` (for example `Edit(//opt/data/**)`); paths under your home use `~/`.

## /v3-review

Renamed from `/review-mine` in v0.9.0 so it no longer clashes with project-level skills of that name. Update allow rules from `skills/review-mine/scripts/*` to `skills/v3-review/scripts/*`. A ticket started before v0.9.0 keeps its review evidence under `review-mine/` in the ticket workspace; finish it on v0.8.x or start it again.

Reviews the current branch with fresh critics, keeps only findings that come with evidence, fixes Critical and Important ones with a failing test first, re-reviews the fixes with a new critic, and stops at an explicit PASS, a plateau, or the budget. It commits fixes to your branch and never pushes.

```
/v3-review [base] [--depth lite|standard|full] [--criteria <file>] [--scope <file>] [--graded <graded.md>]
             [--no-fix] [--prove "<cmd>" [--reset "<cmd>" --env-file <file> --db-pattern <regex>]]
```

**Parallel tasks.** `/v3-ticket`'s planner lists each task's files and dependencies; `waves.sh` groups tasks that share no files and do not depend on each other into waves. BUILD runs a wave's implementers at the same time, each in its own agent worktree, then cherry-picks their commits onto the ticket branch in plan order (a conflict reruns that task on its own) and reviews each task as usual. The brief shows the waves and a `parallel: on|off` switch (on by default; off for lite).

**Depths.** `lite` runs one Opus critic and fixes inline (budget 3 dispatches, 2 rounds). `standard` runs three critics and a fixer agent (budget 10, 4 rounds). `full` runs five critics (impact, security, regression, requirements, maintainability), then a `finding-challenger` (Opus) that tries to refute each Critical and Important finding from the code. Refuted findings never reach the fixer and are listed in the report under "Refuted by the challenger", where you can overrule them (budget 16, 4 rounds). `full` is only used when you ask for it; `/v3-ticket` suggests it for security-sensitive plans with more than 5 tasks.

**UI grading.** For features with a visual or interactive component, pass a graded scoring configuration file. The file defines reference screenshots (`image-dir:`, `route:` or `url:`), routes to capture, dev command, a `rubric:` line pointing to a rubric file (3–6 criteria with anchors for scores 1, 3, and 5), and thresholds (margin 0.3, floor 3.5, min 3). The reference is one page, compared with the first route in the routes file; rubric anchors describe qualities, never "same as the reference", and fixers are told not to copy it (a tie on every criterion is raised as a question in the report). The check passes when our score is at least the reference score minus 0.3, at least 3.5 overall, with no criterion below 3, and a second independent scorer agrees. The dev command and the screenshot tool run inside the plugin's scripts, so the `Bash(bash *skills/*/scripts/*)` rule covers them. A page that answers with a non-2xx HTTP status is not captured, and a graded bar that cannot run (dev server, capture or reference failure) ends the review BLOCKED with the reason. Screenshots use Playwright (default `npx --yes playwright screenshot --channel chrome`), which captures light and dark; only the headless Chrome fallback is light only. Requires `Bash(npx --yes playwright*)` permission rule.

Working files go to `~/.v3-gauntlet/tickets/<repo>/_reviews/` (override with `TICKETS_HOME`), never into your project. Claude Code refuses writes under `~/.claude/`, so the workspace lives outside it.

**Permissions.** To run without prompts, allow these in your settings (confirmed in `docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-10-03-phase-1a.md`):
- `Read(~/.v3-gauntlet/**)` and `Edit(~/.v3-gauntlet/**)` (Edit rules cover all file-writing tools; Write rules are not matched)
- `Bash(bash *skills/v3-review/scripts/*)`
- your project's gate commands, for example `Bash(npm test*)`, `Bash(npm run lint*)`
- optional: `Bash(gh pr view*)`, so the bar can be built from your PR description
- for `/v3-ticket` CLOSE: `Bash(git worktree*)`, `Bash(git branch*)`, `Bash(git pull*)`, `Bash(gh pr view*)`, `Bash(gh issue view*)`, `Bash(gh issue close*)`

**Exit pair safety.** `--reset` runs only when the database in `--env-file` matches `--db-pattern` and its host is local. Anything else is refused before a reset runs.

Tests: `bash tests/run.sh`. End-to-end: `tests/SMOKE.md`.

## Guardrails
A `PreToolUse` hook on Bash (`hooks/guard.sh`) blocks:
- **Tool attribution, always:** a `git commit` or `gh pr create`/`edit` whose message or PR text (including `-F`, `--file` and `--body-file` files and heredocs) carries a Claude co-author trailer or a "Generated with Claude Code" footer.
- **Unapproved pushes, during a ticket:** `git push` from a ticket's branch before phase `pr`, unless SHIP recorded `push_approved: yes` after your go-ahead.
- **Base-branch commits, during a ticket:** `git commit` on a ticket's `base_branch` from `approved` to `handoff`.

It fails open: unreadable input or ticket state allows the command, and every other command passes untouched. To turn it off for a session, start Claude Code with `V3_GAUNTLET_GUARD=off` in its environment (setting it inside a Bash command does nothing, because the hook runs in Claude Code's environment). Known limits: a message built at runtime (for example `-m "$(cat file)"`) is not seen, and a `-F <file>` argument of another command in the same line (for example `grep -F`) is read as a message file.

## Add a workflow

1. Create the file in the right directory with kebab-case name and `description` frontmatter.
2. Run `./scripts/validate.sh`.
3. Bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. This is required for the change to reach other machines.
4. Commit (`feat:`), run `bash scripts/check-commits.sh` before pushing, then push and `git tag vX.Y.Z`.

## Rules

This repo is public. No employer names, internal hostnames, chat room or account IDs, tracker
URLs, ticket contents or project code. Project-specific values live in the work project's own
`.claude/` (a private config file), never here. List the names to keep out in that project's
`.claude/v3-gauntlet-deny.txt`; SHIP refuses a PR that contains them.
