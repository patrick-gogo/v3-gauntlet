# Screenshot routes of a running site for the graded bar.
# Usage: capture.sh <base-url> <routes-file> <out-dir>
# Routes file: one path per line ("/", "/pricing"); "#" starts a comment.
# Writes <out-dir>/<route>-<desktop|phone>-<light|dark>.png with the Playwright CLI
# (CAPTURE_PW overrides the command, default "npx --yes playwright"); falls back to Chrome
# headless (CHROME_BIN, default the macOS app), which captures light mode only.
# CAPTURE_PW_CHANNEL (default "chrome") is passed as --channel to the Playwright screenshot
# command, so it drives the installed Chrome instead of its bundled headless shell (which can
# be missing); set it to the empty string to omit the flag. CAPTURE_PW is split on spaces into a command
# and its arguments, so it cannot contain a path with spaces.
# Old *.png files in <out-dir> are removed first; two routes that map to the same file name
# ("/a/b" and "/a-b") are could-not-run.
# Before any screenshot, every route's URL is fetched with curl (CAPTURE_CURL overrides the
# command, default "curl"; it must print the HTTP status code): a non-2xx answer, such as a 404
# or 500 page, is "CAPTURE: could-not-run (HTTP <code> at <url>)", never a screenshot.
# Prints "CAPTURE: ok <n>[ (fallback: light only)]" or "CAPTURE: could-not-run <reason>". Exit 0 or 3.
