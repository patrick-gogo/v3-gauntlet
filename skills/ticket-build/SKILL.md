# BUILD

Read `v3-gauntlet:ticket-workspace` first. `S` = `bash "$SKILL_DIR/../ticket-workspace/scripts/state.sh" <WS>/state.md`; `R` = `$SKILL_DIR/../v3-review/scripts`.

## Rules
- Ask the user nothing. Stop only for: an irreversible or destructive action, a security-sensitive action, an outside side effect (push, publish, send), or a plan so broken that every path is a guess. Every other decision is a ruling in `WS/rulings.md` (`source: orchestrator`, with cost if wrong).
- Never push. Never edit settings. Commit messages carry no trailers.
- Never trust a subagent's claim of green: re-run the gates yourself.
- Ledger: one line per completed step in `WS/ledger.md`.
- Resume: after a crash or `/clear`, read `state.md`, `ledger.md` and `git log`; a task with a `task N complete` ledger line is done.

## 0. Every entry, including resumes
**Where to work.** Read `checkout` from state.
- `worktree` (the default; no path recorded yet): once, add `.claude/worktrees/` to `$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/info/exclude` if it is not there. If `.claude/worktrees/<ticket id>` already exists (a crash after creating it), call `EnterWorktree` with `path` set to it instead of creating a new one. Otherwise call the `EnterWorktree` tool with `name` = the ticket ID (it creates the worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` and moves the session into it). Right after `EnterWorktree` returns, before anything else, `S set checkout "<the worktree path>"` (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`), so a crash from here on resumes in this worktree. `EnterWorktree` checks out a branch of its own; when it is not the ticket's `<branch>`, record it for CLOSE: `S set worktree_branch "$(git branch --show-current)"`. Then `git switch <branch>` if the branch exists, else `git switch -c <branch> <base>`. The worktree sits inside the main checkout under `.claude/worktrees/`; test runners or linters that the main checkout runs and that do not skip dot-folders should exclude `.claude/worktrees/` in the project's own config (or the project uses `checkout: main`).
- A path: enter it as the Worktrees rule in `v3-gauntlet:ticket-workspace` says (`EnterWorktree` with `path`).
- `main`: work in the main checkout. This is the only case where BUILD switches branches there.

Then check the branch: `git branch --show-current` must equal `branch`. If it does not and the tree is clean, `git switch <branch>`; when the branch does not exist yet (PLAN only records its name), create it from the recorded base: `git switch -c <branch> <base>`. If the tree is dirty, stop and tell the user (another branch has uncommitted work). Never commit on any other branch.

## 1. Pre-flight (skip if `preflight` is `done`)
1. Phase must be `approved` or `round2`; HEAD on `branch`; tree clean.
2. `bash "$R/workspace.sh" --at "<WS>/v3-review"` (sets the pointer every review script uses).
3. Baseline, only when `round2` is `no` and HEAD equals `base`: run each gate `bash "$R/gate-select.sh" --all <config> <base> HEAD` prints (config and exit-3 fallback as `v3-gauntlet:ticket-workspace` section Gates says) as `bash "$R/run-gate.sh" baseline-<name> <gate_timeout> -- "<command>"` (`{tests}` as the workspace skill's Gates section says); write `WS/baseline.md` (status per gate, citing `v3-review/logs/baseline-<name>.status`; failing gates are known reds). For a known-red gate, also list the names of the failing tests from its log, so later runs can tell old failures from new ones. Write `WS/gates.txt` with one `<name>: <command>` line per gate. A gate that is `could-not-run` → `S phase implementing`, `S phase blocked`, ledger the reason, and go to section 4.
3b. If `graded` is set: start and stop the dev server once (`bash "$R/dev-server.sh" start "<dev>" 120`, then `stop`) and capture the reference once into `v3-review/graded/reference` as v3-review section 4b describes. `could-not-run` → ask nothing (BUILD is autonomous): drop the graded bar with a ruling, `S set graded none`, and say so in the handoff.
4. If `exit_pair` is not `none`: `bash "$R/exit-pair.sh" --check <flags>`; refused → drop it with a ruling and `S set exit_pair none`.
5. `S phase implementing`, then `S set preflight done` (in this order, so a crash in between reruns pre-flight instead of leaving the phase behind).

In round 2, `ticket-ship` resets `preflight`; this stage then repeats steps 1, 2, 4 and 5 and keeps the original baseline.

## 2. Task driver
For each `### Task N` in `plan.md` (and the tasks under `## Round 2` when `round2` is `yes`; their numbers continue from round 1) without a `task N complete` ledger line, in order:
1. Record `task_base` = `git rev-parse HEAD`.
2. Write `WS/briefs/task-N.md`: the task text verbatim; the rulings that apply; one gate line per gate `bash "$R/gate-select.sh" --task <config> <task base> HEAD` picks for the task's diff (`bash "$R/run-gate.sh" task<N>-<name> <gate_timeout> -- "<command>"`, `{tests}` scoped); the scope file `WS/scope.txt`; `REPORT: WS/reports/task-N.md`.
3. Before any dispatch: if `budget_impl_used` ≥ `budget_impl_max`, add a ruling, stop the task driver, and go to section 3 (the review budget is separate).
4. **standard and full:** dispatch `v3-gauntlet:task-implementer` (model sonnet) with `BRIEF`; `S incr budget_impl_used`. **lite:** implement the task yourself under `superpowers:test-driven-development` and write the same report.
5. Report says `BLOCKED` → ruling; if the plan cannot continue without the task, that is stop condition 4: `S phase blocked`, go to section 4.
6. Re-run the gates the brief lists as `task<N>-<name>`, and run the test named in the report's GREEN line yourself: it must pass at HEAD. The reviewer checks that the RED test would fail without the change. A gate counts as **new red** when it fails now but passed in the baseline, **or** when it was a known red and its log now names a failing test that the baseline did not. A new red is triaged: product bug → fix round; test defect → fix the test, not the product; environment → record a blocker and do not touch product code; hung → one retry with a longer timeout only if a ruling allows. Then `bash "$R/scope-check.sh" <task_base> "<WS>/scope.txt"`: `forbidden` → fix round; `out-of-scope` → ruling.
7. **standard and full:** `bash "$R/review-package.sh" <task_base> HEAD "<WS>/v3-review/tasks/task-N"`; dispatch `v3-gauntlet:task-reviewer` with `BRIEF`, `REPORT`, `PACKAGE`, `RULINGS`; `S incr budget_impl_used`. `CHANGES` → fix round.
8. **Fix round** (at most 2 per task): a new `task-implementer` dispatch with `BRIEF` plus `FINDINGS` (the open Critical/Important findings and gate failures, written to `WS/briefs/task-N-fix<k>.md`), then steps 6–7 again with a new reviewer. Still open after 2 rounds → append them to `WS/bar.md` under `Known open issues to verify:` so the review loop checks them again.
9. Ledger: `task N complete <task_base>..<HEAD> gates <summary> review <verdict>`; `S incr tasks_done`.

## 2b. Parallel waves (standard and full, `parallel: on`)
When `parallel` is `on`, run section 2 wave by wave. If `bash "$R/waves.sh" "<WS>/plan.md"` exits non-zero, add a ruling and run section 2 task by task. Once per run, add `.claude/worktrees/` to `$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/info/exclude` if it is not there (agent worktrees live there). For each `Wave <k>` line, counting only tasks without a `task N complete` ledger line:
1. One task left → section 2 as written.
2. Several tasks: if the ledger has lines for this wave, follow **Resume** below first. Otherwise record `wave_base` = `git rev-parse HEAD` and append `wave <k> start <wave_base> tasks <numbers>`. Do section 2 steps 2–3 for every task; if the budget cannot cover them all, run the wave one task at a time with section 2. Add to each brief: "You are in a fresh worktree: if a gate fails only because dependencies are missing, run the project's install command once (for example `npm ci`) and rerun it; a gate that still cannot run is reported as could-not-run, never fixed by changing code." Dispatch one `v3-gauntlet:task-implementer` per task **in one message, in parallel**, each with `isolation: "worktree"`, `BRIEF` and `START: <wave_base>` (an agent worktree starts from the remote's default branch, not from this branch: spike `docs/superpowers/spikes/2026-10-04-parallel-worktrees.md`); `S incr budget_impl_used` once per dispatch. For each result append `wave <k> task N worktree <path> branch <branch> status <DONE|BLOCKED>`.
3. Remove the wave's worktrees before anything runs in this checkout (test runners would scan the copies), keeping their branches: `git worktree unlock <path>` (agent worktrees are locked), then `git worktree remove --force <path>`.
4. In plan order, for each task:
   - `STATUS: BLOCKED` → section 2 step 5; nothing is picked.
   - Check `git merge-base --is-ancestor <wave_base> <branch>` and that `git rev-list --count <wave_base>..<branch>` is at least 1. Either fails (the reset to `START` did not happen, or nothing was committed) → ruling, and run the task again with section 2 steps 3–4 (budget check first) on the current HEAD.
   - Record `task_base` = `git rev-parse HEAD`; `git cherry-pick <wave_base>..<branch>`. A conflict → `git cherry-pick --abort`, ruling, and run the task again with section 2 steps 3–4 (budget check first) on the current HEAD. Append `wave <k> task N picked <task_base>..<HEAD>`.
   - Section 2 steps 6–9 for that task (gates, review package `<task_base>..HEAD`, reviewer, fix rounds on this branch, ledger).
   - `git branch -D <branch>`.

**Resume** (a crash mid-wave): if `git rev-parse -q --verify CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` succeeds, `git cherry-pick --abort`. Use the wave's ledger lines: a task with a `picked` line and no `complete` line continues at section 2 step 6 with that range; a task with a `branch` line whose branch still exists and no `picked` line goes to step 4 (its work is kept); every other task of the wave is dispatched again as in step 2 with the recorded `wave_base`. Remove any worktree that `git worktree list` still shows under `.claude/worktrees/` (step 3).

## 3. Review loop
1. `S phase reviewing`.
2. Invoke `v3-gauntlet:v3-review` in embedded mode: base = `base`, `--workspace "<WS>/v3-review"` (round 2: `"<WS>/v3-review-r2"`, so round-1 evidence is kept), `--criteria "<WS>/bar.md"`, `--scope "<WS>/scope.txt"`, `--baseline "<WS>/baseline.md"`, `--gates "<WS>/gates.txt"`, `--gate-timeout <gate_timeout>`, `--depth <depth>`, `--budget <budget_review_max>`, `--graded "<graded>"` when `graded` is set and not `none`, plus the `exit_pair` flags when set. The review covers the whole branch in both rounds, so every bar is judged on the whole feature. When the loop starts a fix round, `S phase fixing`; when it re-reviews, `S phase reviewing`.
3. Read `status` from that review workspace's `state.md`: `ready` → `S phase ready`; anything else → `S phase blocked`.

## 4. Hand over
Ledger: `build finished <phase>`. Invoke `v3-gauntlet:ticket-ship`.
