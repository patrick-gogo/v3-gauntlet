description: CLOSE stage of /v3-ticket - once the ticket's PR is merged, marks the ticket done, cleans up the branch and worktree, and closes the workspace. Changes nothing while the PR is not merged.

# CLOSE

Read `v3-gauntlet:ticket-workspace` first. `S` = `bash "$SKILL_DIR/../ticket-workspace/scripts/state.sh" <WS>/state.md`. Ask nothing; running `/v3-ticket <id>` is the request.

1. Phase must be `pr`. `STATE=$(bash "$SKILL_DIR/../ticket-workspace/scripts/pr-state.sh" <pr_url>)`.
   - `open` → say the PR is still open (and its URL); change nothing.
   - `closed-unmerged` → say it was closed without merging; change nothing; to continue, reopen the PR on GitHub and push changes to the branch yourself (CLOSE then reports it open); to abandon the ticket, delete its workspace folder (`ticket-ws.sh path <id>`) and the branch yourself.
   - `could-not-run` → say `gh` could not read the PR; change nothing.
2. `merged`:
   1. Mark the ticket done with what the machine offers. Report which happened.
      - `issue_url` is set (`S get issue_url`): `gh issue view <issue_url> --json state --jq .state`. `CLOSED` (e.g. GitHub closed it from "Closes #n") → report it is already closed; do not comment. `OPEN` → `gh issue close <issue_url> --comment "Done in <pr_url>"`. Anything else → print the manual step.
      - Never close a GitHub issue by bare number (`gh issue close <n>` targets the current repo, which may not be the ticket's). No `issue_url` → treat the ticket as another tracker's.
      - Another tracker → its MCP tool if available; otherwise print the one manual step.
   2. If the session is in the ticket's worktree, `ExitWorktree` with `action: "keep"` first.
   3. If `checkout` is a worktree path: `git worktree remove <path>` (never with `--force`; report a refusal).
   4. In the main checkout, if its tree is clean (this is where `git switch` runs): `git switch <base_branch>` and, when a remote exists, `git pull --ff-only`.
   5. Delete the local branch: `git branch -d <branch>`. If git refuses (a squash or rebase merge), run `bash "$SKILL_DIR/../ticket-workspace/scripts/pr-state.sh" --head-matches <pr_url> <branch>`:
      - `same` → the local tip is exactly the PR head GitHub merged, so no unmerged work is lost: `git branch -D <branch>`, and report why `-D` was safe.
      - `differs` or `could-not-run` → never `-D`; keep the branch, report why, and tell the user they may delete it with `git branch -D <branch>` after checking it holds nothing unmerged.
   6. Ledger line with `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`; `S phase closed`. Tell the user the ticket is closed.
